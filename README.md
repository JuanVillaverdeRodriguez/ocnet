**OCNET** is a free, digital, modular, and easy-to-use synthesizer designed to provide both experienced and beginner music producers with a free modular alternative to the commercial options currently available on the market. It includes the essential features every synthesizer needs to create unique sounds in a creative and versatile way. Each module has been implemented with a focus on both quality and efficiency.
